                    <h3>The Basics</h3>

                    <h4>What is a Civic Startup?</h4>

                    <p>Civic startups are companies that use government data to produce software applications and government services. In the words of Philadelphia’s CIO <a href="http://civic.io/2012/01/06/five-things-governments-can-do-to-encourage-civic-startups/">Mark Headd</a>, “a ‘civic startup’ is a startup company with a focus on civic improvement or social good.“</p>

                    <h4>Where Would I be Working?</h4>

                    <p>Every month for the course of the program, you'll convene at&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/IqhhH">Code for America HQ in downtown San Francisco</a> for a week of mentorship, meetings and training. Many teams travel back and forth between SF and their hometowns for the duration of this program.</p>

                    <h4>Will I Receive Wages During the Accelerator?</h4>

                    <p>In addition to receiving <a href="#training">training and mentorship</a>, startups receive $25,000 USD per team to grow their businesses.</p>

                    <h3>Eligibility and Selection</h3>

                    <h4>Selection Criteria</h4>

                    <p>We are looking for startups who are providing services on top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">open data</a>, bringing modern web technology to governments, and changing the way citizens request or receive services from government. Code for America seeks a diverse Accelerator class in all regards. We seek applications from a broad spectrum of companies — in size, in the definition of civic, and in geographic location. And we encourage female and minority founded startups to apply.</p>
